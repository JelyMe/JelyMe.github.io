# Our Exams

A website originally created by four students in New Zealand,
an archive with all of *our exams* that NCEA has now removed.
Now with plenty of help from others!

You can access it at <https://ourexams.org/>

Please report any bugs or issues [here](https://forms.gle/u22nQarT9DabZozB6)!
The site should be pretty self explanatory, but if it isn't, let us know!

Here to help? Have a look at [contributing.md](contributing.md).
